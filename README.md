#My movie List

I have created an exciting movie app that offers users a seamless experience. Users can effortlessly search for their favorite movies by typing in the title or keywords using the intuitive search bar. As they submit the search query, the app dynamically fetches movie data from the OMDB API and presents an array of matching movies in a sleek and organized list.

Upon spotting a movie that piques their interest, users can simply click on it to unveil a world of detailed information. This includes essential details like the movie's release year, runtime, and IMDb rating, presented in a visually appealing layout. Users can also explore the captivating movie posters, adding to the immersive experience
